# ML-Regression-project
Welcome to the Machine Learning Regression project focused on predicting real estate prices in the Wroclaw market. In this project, data was scraped from a popular classified ads website, underwent a thorough cleaning process, outliers were removed, and the dataset was carefully prepared for analysis. Various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and XGBRegressor, were tested for their effectiveness in predicting real estate prices.

Project Overview
Data Collection: The project involves scraping real estate data from a popular classified ads website.

Data Cleaning: A meticulous data cleaning process was applied to ensure the dataset's integrity, and outliers were identified and removed.

Model Testing: Several regression models, such as Linear Regression, Ridge, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and XGBRegressor, were tested for their suitability in predicting real estate prices.

Model Selection: The most effective model was selected using cross-validation techniques to ensure robust performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: To optimize model performance, hyperparameter tuning was conducted for the selected models.

Handling Missing Values: The project explores the impact of different methods for handling missing values, serving as an educational component for understanding the implications of various approaches.
